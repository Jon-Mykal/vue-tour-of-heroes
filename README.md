# vue-tour-of-heroes
This is a project based on Google's Angular Tutorial (https://angular.io/tutorial) that was done using Vue 3 with the new Composition API along with a few features such as Vue Router and Vuex. This was done to utilize all the concepts I learned on Vue Mastery (http://vuemastery.com/) to see how they fit in a simple project.
